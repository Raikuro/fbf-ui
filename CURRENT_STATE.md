## Completed Milestones & Phases

- [x] **P0 — Repository Architecture & Investigation**: Evaluated stack options, established dependency strategy, defined layer boundaries, produced capability matrix and visualization catalog.
- [x] **P1 — Project Bootstrap & Tooling** (Frozen at commit `5009989`): Created `fbf-ui` package, set up setuptools configuration, dedicated `.venv`, FastAPI app shell, health endpoint reporting installed `fbf-core` version, contract tests, and documentation.
- [x] **P2 — Application Shell & UI Presentation Foundation** (Frozen at commit `7b9337b`): Built Jinja2 presentation templates (`base.html`, `dashboard.html`, `study.html`, `run.html`, `results.html`, `compare.html`, `persistence.html`), static dark theme CSS (`/static/css/app.css`), package-relative path resolution, active tab navbar highlighting, template unit tests, and scaffolding placeholders.

## Active Phase: P2 Application Shell & Presentation Foundation

### Status
Phase P2 is **COMPLETE** and frozen at commit `7b9337b`.

## Frozen Architectural Decisions

1. **Technology Stack**: FastAPI + Pydantic v2 + Uvicorn HTTP server with initial server-rendered presentation, preserving a clean REST API seam for future SPA integration (ADR 001).
2. **Dependency Boundary**: `fbf-ui` depends directly on `fbf-core` (Tier 1 & Tier 2). No imports or subprocess calls to `fbf-cli` (ADR 002).
3. **File Handling**: Explicit distinction between browser uploads, server filesystem references, persisted configs, and SQLite database paths (ADR 003).
4. **Configuration Adapter**: `fbf-core`'s `StudyConfiguration` is the canonical source of truth, adapted via UI DTOs (ADR 004).
5. **Visualization Pipeline**: Financial metrics computed in Core; UI transforms execution results into visualization view models (ADR 005).

## Next Steps

1. Await explicit user instructions and planning approval for **P3 — YAML Workflows & Configuration Parsing**.
